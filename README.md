# Summary
This repo includes code used to analyze data in Viswanathan et al. (submitted). 
The analysis investigates the impacts of fragmentation on conspecific 
density dependence (CDD) of seedling survival. The experiment was set up in
21 forest fragments embedded in Kadumane Tea Estate (Karnataka, India), with
seedling plots treated with fungicides, insecticide, a combination of both or
controls (either water or a no-manipulation control).
